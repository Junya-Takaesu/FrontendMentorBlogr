## My process

### Built with

- Bootstrap 5
  - Used Bootstrap for layouts like grid and flexbox.
- Minimum CSS
  - Because I was able to style the site using Bootstrap classes to style elements, I used minimum CSS.
  - Used sass to create structured styles which makes it easy for me to understand which styles apply which elements.
- Vanilla JS
  - No libraries used, so that codebase is unreasonably huge considering the scale of this challenge project.
  - Should've used any libraries like jQuery in the hindsight.(Plus side is I learned a lot about javascript.)
- Translate texts into Japanese because I live in Japan.

### What I learned


### Continued development

* Use any JS libraries to make it easier to style the page and add animations.
* Compiling like webpack.
